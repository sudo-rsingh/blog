            <h1>Capturing Basic Market Profits</h1>
            <h2>Making massive profits in stock market is a very easy thing of basic pattern recognition.</h2>
            <p class="date">May 06, 2025</p>

                <p>
                    I have been investing in stock market for more than 5 years now and have been studing global markets
                    for more than 8 years now. This early age obsession with stock market was mostly driven by greed and
                    a possibility of getting rich quickly. While this can be considered a bad thing but overtime it had
                    made sure that I have always made good profits while not being exposed to any major risk. This blog
                    will majorly cover about fundamental and value investing, which I have used for all the gains overtime.
                </p>
                
                <blockquote>
                    <p>"Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful." — Warren Buffett</p>
                </blockquote>
                
                <h2>Introduction</h2>

                <p>
                    If I said that I only follow that quote and invest based on that, that would be very foolish and outright
                    a major lie which can cause major financial damage to the follower. I will take some time and explain the
                    quote by Buffet, he essentially mean there that when people are selling and the price of stock is crashing
                    we should buy at that time and vice versa. But is it a sound advice to just but anything which that majority
                    people are being warry of, that would be dumb on multiple levels. I will illustrate an example with this
                    same advice working and an example when this advice is not working in upcomming sections.
                    <br>
                    A very thorough analysis is always required before making any purchage or sale of stocks which should not
                    be neglected under any circumstances. New and active investors have a tendency of making fast purchages on
                    identifying a good opportunity, while it is suggested that we launch towards a good chance it is not uncommon
                    to see that many good purchages fail when we do things haistly, this can be very well explained by the
                    current market conditions where we can see that the NIFTY50 is going at the top but the overall market is down
                    and can even be said that it is in miserable condition. Some people might think of this as an opportunity
                    while others might think of it as a major obstacle. My stance over this is much more complicated than these
                    two options, I see it as a opportunity but not a opportunity to make money but an opportunity to learn how
                    to make money, this situation is a common trend of the market which happens over 15-20 years time frame and
                    there is so much to learn from it because there are a plenty of pit falls which are dug by the market and
                    any untrained person who wants to make quick money will fall in it.
                </p>

                <h2>Escaping the high charges of the brokers</h2>

                <p>
                    This sections will matter more to the people who might be involved in day trading, options or future trading.
                    Regardless I felt that this is an important thing which normal people who just want to do delivery trade
                    should also be aware of. In earlier time when the orders used to be placed by human interventions there used
                    to be human brokers and they charged absurd prices and many time recommended stocks with frodulant fundamentals.
                    This majorly stopped when discount brokers were introduced, they did not have such a large staff so they could
                    offer the placing of order with very low charges. Even then I would always say to go to the broker who gives
                    the lowest charges. One thing which you will notice when you try out multiple brokers is that even when they say
                    that they charge 0 brokrage fee there is still difference between the total fee of different brokers.
                    <br>
                    Now some of the new traders might be thinking that anyways brokrage fee is a small part of there total investment
                    and it doesnot matter in the long run
